# Rust Quiz CLI

A terminal-based **Rust quiz game** that picks random questions (1–50), presents them to the user, and keeps score.

This project is a learning-oriented Rust command-line application. It demonstrates common Rust concepts such as:
- reading user input
- working with vectors, iterators, and filtering
- random number generation
- ownership and borrowing  
and basic CLI I/O.  

## 💡 Features

- Prompt the user for how many questions to attempt
- Randomly select that number of unique questions from a question bank
- Display questions + options
- Accept user answers and track score
- Provide a final result

## 🚀 Getting Started
